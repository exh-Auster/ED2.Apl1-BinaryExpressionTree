# Arithmetic Expression Binary Tree

This is a project for implementing an arithmetic expression binary tree in Java and testing its implementation, so that the program can evaluate arithmetic expressions correctly. The program presents a menu of options containing 5 options:

1. Input of the arithmetic expression in infix notation.
2. Creation of the arithmetic expression binary tree.
3. Display of the arithmetic expression binary tree.
4. Calculation of the expression (performing the tree traversal).
5. Program termination.

## Features

- Input of arithmetic expressions in infix notation
- Creation of arithmetic expression binary trees
- Display of arithmetic expression binary trees
- Calculation of arithmetic expressions using the binary tree

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Run the `Main.java` file
4. Follow the instructions in the console to perform the desired operations on the arithmetic expression binary tree

## Technologies used

- Java 11
- JUnit 5 (for unit testing)
